\description{
The artifical dataset of a binary type responses which contains of three subsets with different discrimination values.
To reproduce this dataset: \cr\cr
\code{dicho_inh_dset <- generate_data(responseType = "discriminate", ncat = 2, alpha = c(0.04,0.045,0.05,0.055,0.06,0.065,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.35,0.4,0.45,2.6,2.65,2.7,2.75,2.8,2.85,2.9))}
\cr\cr will lead to similar but not the same dataset, due to the randomization.
